'''WORLD CENSUS PORTFOLIO PROJECT'''

This is a repository for my world census data analytics project files. Data from each country census from 1960 to 2018 was transfromed and uploaded to Power BI to create a simple dashboard that helps navegate through the information and get useful insights.

The data was taken from Google BigQuery public data repository.

Here a snapshot of how the Power BI Dashboard looks like:

Users can utilize slicers to select a single country and one or multiple years to visualize the data.

I am fully committed to acquiring all the necessary skills to become a great data analyst. 

Let's keep practicing! ðŸ™Œ
